Import Test Data
================

Before you can really experiment with CrateDB, you need some data to play
around with.

In this document, we show you how to import test data.

.. NOTE::

   This document assumes that you have CrateDB :ref:`installed and running
   <install-run>`.

Introducing: The CrateDB Admin UI
=================================

CrateDB ships with a web administration user interface (UI), or `admin UI`_ for
short.

The CrateDB admin UI runs on every CrateDB node, and you can use it to inspect
and interact with the whole CrateDB cluster in a number of ways.

We will use the admin UI throughout this section.

Access the admin UI in your browser using a URL like this::

  http://localhost:4200/

If CrateDB is not running locally, replace ``localhost`` with the hostname
CrateDB is running on.

You should see something like this:

Import Some Tweets
==================

In the admin UI, select the *Help* tab (question mark icon) from the left-hand
navigation menu.

You should see something like this:

.. image:: admin-ui-help.png

Select *IMPORT TWEETS FOR TESTING* and follow the instructions to authenticate
your Twitter account.

.. NOTE::

   Don't worry. This isn’t going to post anything on your behalf. It doesn’t
   even look at your tweets. All this does is import a selection of recent
   public tweets on Twitter.

Leave this running and stop it when you have enough tweets. Aim for at least
few thousand.

When you're done, select the *Tables* icon from the left-hand navigation.

You should see something like this:
