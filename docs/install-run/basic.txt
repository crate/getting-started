==================================
Basic CrateDB Tarball Installation
==================================


This page shows you how get up and running directly from the tarball.

.. NOTE::

   Specialised install guides are available for: :ref:`Linux <linux-install>`,
   :ref:`Mac OS X <mac-install>`, :ref:`Windows <windows-install>`, and
   :ref:`Docker <docker-install>`.

.. CAUTION::

   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.

.. _deploying: https://crate.io/docs/crate/guide/en/latest/deployment/index.html
.. _scaling: https://crate.io/docs/crate/guide/en/latest/scaling/index.html

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB requires `Java 8`_. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on Mac OS X
   and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.

   The same JVM version must be used on all CrateDB nodes.

   We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.

Download
========

Download `the latest CrateDB release`_.

.. TIP::

   Other releases of CrateDB are `also available`_.

   Check out the `release notes`_ for specific information about each CrateDB
   release.

Once downloaded, unpack the tarball and change into the resulting directory::

   sh$ tar -xzf crate-*.tar.gz
   sh$ cd crate-*

Run
===

There is no need to configure or build anything.

Once unpacked, CrateDB can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

This command runs a single instance of CrateDB that is bound to the local IP
address.

:kbd:`Control-C` will stop the process.

Pass the ``--help`` option for command usage information::

   sh$ ./bin/crate --help

.. SEEALSO::

   Now you have CrateDB up and running, check out the :ref:`First
   Use <first-use>` section.
