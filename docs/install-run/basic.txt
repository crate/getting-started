Basic CrateDB Tarball Installation
==================================


This page shows you how get up and running directly from the tarball on any
`Unix-like system`_.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB requires `Java 8`_, preferably update 20 or later. We recommend
   using `Oracle's Java`_ on macOS and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.

.. SEEALSO::

   Specialised install guides are available for: :ref:`Linux <linux-install>`,
   :ref:`macOS <mac-install>`, :ref:`Microsoft Windows <windows-install>`, and
   :ref:`Docker <docker-install>`.

   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.

Download
========

Download `the latest CrateDB release`_.

Once downloaded, unpack the tarball and change into the resulting directory:

.. code-block:: console

   sh$ tar -xzf crate-*.tar.gz
   sh$ cd crate-*

.. SEEALSO::

   Other releases of CrateDB are `also available`_.

   Check out the `release notes`_ for specific information about each CrateDB
   release.

Run
===

There is no need to configure or build anything.

Once unpacked, CrateDB can be started in the foreground like this:

.. code-block:: console

   sh$ ./bin/crate

This command runs a single instance of CrateDB that is bound to the local IP
address.

:kbd:`Control-C` will stop the process.

.. SEEALSO::

   Consult the `CrateDB reference documentation`_ for help using this command.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB performs a number of `bootstrap checks`_ on startup.

Next Steps
==========

Now you have CrateDB up and running, it's time to :ref:`import some test data
<import-test-data>`.
