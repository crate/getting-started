====================
Specialized installs
====================

CrateDB is easy to :ref:`get up and running directly from the tarball
<basic-install>`. But we also have a few specialized guides for quickly getting
set up with CrateDB.

.. SEEALSO::

   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.
