Install CrateDB on Microsoft Windows
====================================

Because CrateDB is a Java application, it runs effortlessly on Microsoft
Windows.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB requires `Java 11`_. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on
   Microsoft Windows.

.. SEEALSO::

   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.

Download and run
================

For this specialized guide, we have adapted the :ref:`basic tarball
installation <basic-install>` instructions for use with Windows
`PowerShell`_.

Download `the latest CrateDB release`_.

Once downloaded, expand the tarball using a tool like `7-Zip`_.

`Start PowerShell`_, `change into the expanded tarball folder`_, and start
CrateDB, like so:

.. code-block:: doscon

   PS> ./bin/crate

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB performs a number of `bootstrap checks`_ on startup.

Next steps
==========

Now you have CrateDB up and running, it's time to :ref:`import some test data
<import-test-data>`.
