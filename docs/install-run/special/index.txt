====================
Specialized Installs
====================

CrateDB is super easy to :ref:`get up and running directly from the tarball
<basic-install>`. But we also have these specialized install guides for
different operating systems or running on Docker, if that's more your thing.

.. NOTE::

   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.
