Install CrateDB on Linux
========================

CrateDB maintains packages for `Debian GNU/Linux`_, `Ubuntu`_, and `RedHat
Linux`_.

.. SEEALSO::

One-Step Setup
==============

If you're using one of these operating systems, our one-step installer will
automatically configure your system and install the correct package for you:

.. code-block:: console

   sh$ bash -c "$(curl -L install.crate.io)"

If you don't already have `Java 8`_ installed, the above command will try to take
care of that for you along with a few other housekeeping tasks.

Next Steps
==========

Now you have CrateDB up and running, it's time to :ref:`import some test data
<import-test-data>`.
