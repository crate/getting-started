You can install and run CrateDB on a Mac with one simple command in your
terminal application:

.. code-block:: sh

    bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"

If you don't already have `Java 8`_ installed, the above command will try to take
care of that for you.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB requires `Java 8`_. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on Mac OS X

   The same JVM version must be used on all CrateDB nodes.

   We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.

To create a cluster, run the above command multiple times to create new
instances that will discover each when running on the same machine.
