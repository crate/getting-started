Install CrateDB with our one-step installer, like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"

If you don't already have `Java 8`_ installed, the above command will try to take
care of that for you along with a few other housekeeping tasks.

.. CAUTION::

   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.

.. _scaling: https://crate.io/docs/crate/guide/en/latest/scaling/index.html

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB requires `Java 8`_. We recommend using `Oracle's Java`_ on Mac OS X.

   The same JVM version must be used on all CrateDB nodes.

   We recommend installing `Java 8`_ update 20 or later.
