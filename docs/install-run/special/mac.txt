   These instructions are designed to get you up and running on your personal
   computer.

   For putting CrateDB into production, you can learn more about
   `deploying`_ or `scaling`_ CrateDB in the `CrateDB Guide`_.

One-Step Setup
==============

You can install and run CrateDB on macOS with one simple command in your
terminal application:

.. code-block:: console

   sh$ bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"

If you don't already have `Java 11`_ installed, the above command will try to
take care of that for you along with a few other housekeeping tasks.

.. NOTE::

   CrateDB performs a number of `bootstrap checks`_ on startup.

Next Steps
==========

Now you have CrateDB up and running, it's time to :ref:`import some test data
<import-test-data>`.
