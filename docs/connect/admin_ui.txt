Connect to Cluster
==================

Visit the admin interface in your browser at a URL like this one::

  http://localhost:4200/

Here's what you should see:

.. NOTE::

    The admin interface runs on each CrateDB node.

.. NOTE::

    If port ``4200`` is accessed via a client library or command line tool like
    ``curl`` or ``wget``, the request will be handled by `the CrateDB Rest
    API`_, and the response will be JSON.

Overview Bar and Tab
--------------------

The top of the screen has overview information about the cluster:

From left to right, this shows:

- The name of the cluster, find out `how to change its value our configuration
  documentation
  <https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html#cluster-name>`_

- The version of CrateDB that the cluster is running.

- The health of the data in the cluster. Green indicates that all data is
  replicated and available, yellow that there are unreplicated records and red
  that data is unavailable.

- Potential configuration problems and recommendations for the cluster.

- Average cluster load over the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

- Settings menu that allows you to update the language settings and provides a
  link to the CrateDB documentation and the latest CrateDB news.

on data availability, cluster load and problems. On the left side of the window
there are five further tabs.
